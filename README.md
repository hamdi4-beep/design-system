# Design System

## Project Overview
It's a customizeable personal playground where I can focus on creating UI components in isolation and keep them as a collection for future reference.

## Getting Started
Here are the basic steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/hamdi4-beep/design-system.git.
2. Run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Run npm run dev to start the development server.
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173.
5. That's it! You should now be able to see the project running locally on your machine.
