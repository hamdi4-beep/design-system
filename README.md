# design-system

## Project Overview
Design System is a sideproject that where I can focus on creating and testing UI components in isolation before they're used in a real project.

## Getting Started
Here are the basic steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/hamdi4-beep/design-system.git.
2. Run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Run npm run dev to start the development server.
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173.
5. That's it! You should now be able to see the project running locally on your machine.
